* **Measurable:** Deliver at least 3 knowledge artifacts in the central repository or Confluence.
* **Achievable:** Allocate 2 hours per week for structured documentation.
* **Relevant:** Enables team onboarding, disaster recovery, and audit compliance.
* **Time-bound:** All documents finalized and shared by end of Q2 2025.

---

#### 11. **Proactively Identify and Mitigate Risks**

* **Specific:** Conduct risk assessments for major OpenPages deployments, focusing on performance degradation, dependency failures, or upgrade fallbacks.
* **Measurable:** Mitigate 100% of high-priority risks before production deployments.
* **Achievable:** Use a risk register and pre-deployment testing protocol.
* **Relevant:** Ensures smooth go-lives with minimal business disruption.
* **Time-bound:** Performed before each major change or release window.

---

#### 12. **Mentor Junior Team Members**

* **Specific:** Provide technical mentoring to junior developers or analysts on OpenPages configurations, performance tuning, and custom solutions.
* **Measurable:** Hold bi-weekly knowledge-sharing sessions; assist in 3+ peer deliverables.
